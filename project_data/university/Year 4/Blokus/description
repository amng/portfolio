Blokus is an adaption of the board game to a computer game. The main goal of this project was to use VDM++ to specify all the game conditions, pre-conditions, and so on, which allowed to specify all the game logic. Later the VDM++ project was used to generate Java code in order to create a playable version of the game with a visual interface.
