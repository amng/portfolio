This project main goal was to create 3 mobile applications and a server. The first application is the client and should allow for the client to buy tickets and use the android smartphone in order to validate and check validated tickets. The second was an application that allows for the bus to communicate to the server and check if a ticket is valid. The final mobile application is the application that allows the ticket inspector to check if the ticket has been validated. 
The server on the other hand is used to communicate with all the mobile applications and manage all the necessary information.
